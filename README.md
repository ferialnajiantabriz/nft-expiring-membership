## Use Case: Monthly Online Study Group

Alice runs a small online study group with ~20 members. Each member needs to pay 
a monthly fee (0.01 ETH) to access premium content and weekly Zoom discussions. 
By issuing an NFT with a 30-day expiration, the group ensures only active, 
paying members can join. After 30 days, the NFT expires, and the member must 
renew on-chain to keep participating.

## Motivation
Large protocols like Unlock often require more complex setups and can be overkill for 
small communities. This project aims to be a lightweight, auditable solution 
that is fully self-contained. It’s ideal for groups of 5–100 members who need 
on-chain proofs of membership without the overhead of big subscription platforms.
