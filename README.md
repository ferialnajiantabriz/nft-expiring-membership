## Specific Use Case & Gap

We target **campus organizations**—for example, a university CS club—that need 
lightweight, monthly digital passes for exclusive events, lab access, or member-only
resources. They require:
- **Zero-infrastructure** on the club’s side: no backend server to maintain.
- **On-chain transparency**: members and organizers can verify payments and expirations.
- **Gasless renewals**: many students lack ETH; they can renew via meta-transactions.
- **Fiat-pegged pricing**: pay in stablecoins (e.g., USDC) to avoid ETH volatility.

No existing solution offers this exact combination—our contract is **minimal**,  
**fully on-chain**, and **auditable** for non-technical student groups.
